# Game of Goose

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose)

## Equipment

The game is played on a spiral shaped board consisting of 63 spaces. There are four differently coloured pieces - often in the shape of a goose and two six-sided dice.

## Preparation and Objective

Pieces are placed on the starting space at the outside of the spiral. Highest roll of the dice starts.

The Game of Goose is a simple race game - first person to reach space **63** wins.

## Play

Players take turns to roll the dice and moved their piece forward by the sum of the two dice.

- If your first throw is six and three, move to space **26**.
- If your first throw is five and four, move to space **53**.
- If a piece lands on an enemy piece, the enemy piece is returned to the space that the piece started from in that turn (i.e. the two pieces swap places).
- If a piece lands on a space with a picture of a goose, it moves forward by same amount again. If this causes the piece to land on another goose, it moves forward again in the same way.

The following spaces are called Hazard spaces and are usually illustrated to match their name. If a piece lands on the space indicated, that piece must follow the stated rule.

- **6 - The Bridge** - Go to space **12**
- **19- The Hotel** - Stay for (miss) one turn
- **31- The Well**- Wait until someone comes to pull you out - they then take your place
- **42- The Maze**-Go back to space **39** (or space **30** in most French games)
- **52- The Prison** -Wait until someone comes to release you - they then take your place
- **58- Death** -Return your piece to the beginning - start the game again

## Winning the Game

To win the game, a piece must land exactly on space **63**.
If a player throws too many, the piece counts the extra points backwards from the winning space. If you then land on a goose space, you must continue moving backwards by the amount of your throw until you land on a space with no goose space. If you land on the Death space, you must start again.
